to run (in linux) just type:

python3 addnumbers.py

into the command line to run.

Takes two numbers, determines if they are prime. If they are not, they find their prime factors. Calculation is done by multiplying all prime factors for the two numbers. Answer is outputed by printing "a". The number of printed a's is the answer.

I do not recommend entering digits over 5 digits long if you would like an answer in a reasonable amount of time.
